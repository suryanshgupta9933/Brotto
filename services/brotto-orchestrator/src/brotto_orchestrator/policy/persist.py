"""Per-user policy persistence.

The in-memory `SessionRegistry` is wiped on every server restart, so a
user who saved their blacklist yesterday returns to a sidepanel showing
only the floor today. This module persists the LAST KNOWN user policy
per user_id (or per client IP) to a JSON file under
`logs/user_policies/<key>.json`. On startup, `SessionRegistry.hydrate`
re-populates the cache from disk so `GET /v1/policy` returns the user's
saved view immediately, even before they reconnect.

`ponytail: ponytail:` single-process JSON files keyed by user_id. A
multi-replica deployment would need a shared store (Postgres / Redis).
The filename is the user_id hash-truncated so we never write to a
predictable path (collision risk on adversarial input).

Format on disk:

    {
      "_saved_at": "2026-08-29T22:01:00Z",
      "_content_sha256": "abc123...",
      "blacklist": ["foo.com", "bar.com"]
    }

The two underscore-prefixed fields are bookkeeping: `_content_sha256`
powers change detection (skip no-op writes), `_saved_at` is the
human-readable timestamp the sidepanel surfaces in its verify-status
footer. They are stripped before hashing so a re-save with identical
content compares equal.
